<div id='write'  class=''><h3 id='risk-factors'><span>Risk Factors</span></h3><p><span>Prospective investors are urged to review carefully and consult independent professional advisors regarding this section headed &quot;</span><strong><span>Risk Factors</span></strong><span>&quot;.</span></p><p><span>An investment in the Product entails certain risks. An investment in the Product requires a thorough understanding of the nature of structured products. Prospective investors in the Product should be experienced concerning an investment in complex financial instruments and be aware of the related risks. A prospective investor in the Product should determine the suitability of such an investment in light of such an investor&#39;s particular circumstances. </span></p><p><span>A prospective investor should not invest in the Product unless such investor has the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Product will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the market value of the relevant Product and the impact such an investment will have on such investor’s overall investment portfolio.  </span></p><p><strong><span>RISKS RELATED TO THE PRODUCT</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>Risk of total loss</span></strong></p><p><span>The Product involves a high degree of risk, and prospective investors in the Product should recognize that, under certain circumstances, the Product may have a redemption value of zero. Prospective investors should, therefore, be prepared to sustain a partial or total loss of the amount of their investment therein. </span></p><p><strong><span>Unpredictable value for the Product</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>During the term of the Product, the value of, and the expected return on, such Product may be influenced by many factors, some or all of which may be unpredictable. Many economic and market factors will influence the value of the Product. The Issuer expects that, generally, the value and volatility of the Underlying on any day will affect the value of the Product more than any other single factor. </span></p><p><span>A prospective investor should not expect, however, the value of the Product to vary in proportion to changes in the value of the Underlying. The return on the Product (if any) may bear little relation to and maybe much less than, the return that the investor therein might have achieved if such investor had invested directly in the Underlying. </span></p><p><span>The value of, and return (if any) on, the Product will be affected by several other factors, which may be unpredictable or beyond the Issuer&#39;s control, and which may offset or magnify each other, including, without limitation: </span></p><p><span>•   the expected frequency and magnitude of changes in the market value of the Underlying; </span></p><p><span>•   economic, financial, political or regulatory events or judicial decisions that affect the Issuer, the Underlying or the cryptocurrencies markets generally; </span></p><p><span>•   interest and yield rates in the market generally; and</span></p><p><span>•   the Issuer’s creditworthiness.</span></p><p><span>Some or all of these factors may influence the price of the Product. The impact of any of the factors set forth above may enhance or offset some or all of any change resulting from another factor or factors. </span></p><p><strong><span>Exposure to the performance of the Underlying</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The Product will represent an investment linked to the performance of the Underlying. The past performance of the Underlying is not indicative of future performance. </span></p><p><span>No obligation on any other party to purchase or hold interests in the Underlying or any components contained in the Underlying </span></p><p><span>Investors should be aware that there is no obligation on the Issuer or any other party to purchase, hold, manage or sell any interests in the Underlying or to have any right, title, interest or benefit in relation to any of the foregoing or any components contained in the Underlying and there is no actual portfolio of assets to which any person is entitled or in which any person has any ownership interest.      </span></p><p><strong><span>Lacking secondary market</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>An investment in the Product is an illiquid investment that involves a high degree of risk because the right to redeem the Product is subject to restrictions. Only investors, who are financially able to maintain their investment and who can afford to lose all or a substantial part of that investment, should invest in the Product. Furthermore, the Issuer does not anticipate that a secondary market will be developed in the Product. Accordingly, Investors may be able to realize their investment in the Product only through the redemption of the Product in accordance with its terms of issue. </span></p><p><strong><span>Early redemption</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The investors must be aware of a possible early redemption of the Product. Upon the occurrence of an extraordinary event, the Issuer has the right to, among other things, early redeem the Product. If the Issuer exercises such early redemption right(s), investors should be aware that the early redemption price (Termination Amount) may be considerably lower than the Initial Price (or, if different, the price the relevant investor paid for the Product) or the Redemption Amount that would otherwise have been paid on the Final Valuation Date. </span></p><p><strong><span>Other Product-specific risks</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Investors should be aware that an investment in the Product generally results in a loss upon redemption if the value of the Underlying decreases. Consequently, the potential loss associated with an investment in the Product is linked to the negative performance of the Underlying. </span></p><p><span>Investors in the Product should be prepared to sustain a partial or total loss of their investment. Owning the Product is not the same as owning the Underlying. </span></p><p><span>Accordingly, changes in the market value of the Underlying may not result in a comparable change in the market value of the Product.  </span></p><p><strong><span>RISKS RELATED TO THE ISSUER</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Investors bear the credit risk of the Issuer. The Product&#39;s retention of value is dependent not only on the development of the value of the Underlying but also on the creditworthiness of the Issuer, which may change over the term of the Product. The investor is exposed to the risk of default of the Issuer. </span></p><p><strong><span>Special Risks related to Crypto Assets as Underlyings</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>General Risk</span></strong></p><p><span>Users of Crypto Assets, such as crypto currencies, are subject to security risks. Therefore Investors in products with Crypto Assets and as underlyings, such as the Products, are exposed to elevated risk of fraud and loss, including, but not limited to, through cyber-attacks. Several exchanges specializing in sales of Crypto Assets such as Bitcoin, for example, have already had to cease their activities or have been closed for other reasons, including, in some cases, because of cyber-attacks. Crypto Assets, such as the Underlyings or Underlying Components of any Product and Crypto Assets used as collateral, such as the Principal, can be stolen. Crypto Assets are stored in a crypto wallet, accessible via a private key, which can be compromised. While crypto wallets do not store or contain the underlying currency, they store public and private keys, which are used as an address for receiving the Crypto Asset or for spending the Crypto Asset, and both forms of transactions are recorded on the public immutable ledger, the blockchain. By using the private key, a person is able to spend the Crypto Asset, effectively sending it away from the account and recording that transaction on the immutable ledger, the blockchain. If a private key is compromised, the Crypto Assets associated with that specific public key may be stolen. Unlike traditional banking transactions, once a transaction has been added to the blockchain, it cannot be reversed. </span></p><p><span>Thefts and cyber-attacks can have a negative impact on the reputation of the currency or the marketplace concerned and thus affect negatively the market price of Crypto Assets. Through the Products, Investors would indirectly participate in such a negative performance, and a loss, including a total loss, would be possible. While the Issuer and the Custodian for the Principal have taken reasonable measures to prevent a theft or hacking of the Underlyings or Underlying Components used for the Products, such event cannot be fully excluded and the losses associated with such an event would be borne by Investors. Moreover, incidences of theft or hacking of Crypto Assets other than the Principal can also negatively influence the market price, value, or liquidity of the Crypto Assets used as underlyings, principals and collaterals for a specific product. </span></p><p><span>Certain Crypto Assets, such as Bitcoins, can be used pseudonymously and do not have to be traded through government institutions or banks. They can be purchased directly from an owner or a certain trading venue. These platforms are generally not regulated. Investors thus face increased risk of the Issuer identifying occurrence of a trading disruption in the broader Crypto Asset market, which could affect the value of their investment in the Product. </span></p><p><span>The market value of most Crypto Assets is not based on any kind of claim, nor backed by any physical asset. Instead, the market value depends entirely on the expectation of being usable in future transactions and continued interest from Investors. This strong correlation between an expectation and market value is the basis for the current and probably future volatility of the market value of most Crypto Assets and may increase the likelihood of momentum pricing. </span></p><p><strong><span>Country-specific Regulatory Risk</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The legal status of Crypto Assets varies substantially from country to country. In many countries, the legal status is still undefined or changing. Some countries have deemed the usage of Bitcoin illegal. Other countries have banned Crypto Assets, banned the local banks from working with Crypto Assets or restricted Crypto Assets in other ways. Furthermore, the status of Crypto Assets remains undefined and there is uncertainty as to whether the Crypto Assets are a security, money, a commodity or property. In some countries, such as the United States, different government agencies define Crypto Assets differently, leading to regulatory conflict and uncertainty. This uncertainty is compounded by the rapid evolution of regulations. Countries may, in the future, explicitly restrict, outlaw or curtail the acquisition, use, trade or redemption of Crypto Assets. In such a scenario, holding or trading products tracking or linked to Crypto Assets, such as the Product, could be considered illegal and could be subject to sanction. </span></p><p><strong><span>Changes in Regulation of Crypto Assets and Regulatory Call</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The regulation of Crypto Assets is subject to change. It cannot, therefore, be ruled out that the regulatory treatment of Crypto Assets or products linked to Crypto Assets by national authorities and courts or international standard setting bodies could be subject to changes in the future. As a result of such changes, the purchase and/or direct or indirect investment in products tracking or linked to Crypto Assets, Crypto Assets, or certain Crypto Assets, including with respect to the Underlyings or Products may be prohibited or otherwise restricted. </span></p><p><span>In accordance with the Terms and Conditions, the Issuer may redeem a Product, </span><em><span>inter alia</span></em><span>, for reasons of regulatory changes affecting the respective Product or any of the Underlyings or Underlying Components (a </span><strong><span>Regulatory Call</span></strong><span>). Accordingly, Investors should consult their personal legal advisors before making any decision to purchase the Products and must be aware of, and be prepared to bear the risk of, a potential early redemption due to regulatory reasons. The Issuer and their affiliates do not accept any liability for adverse regulatory consequences of an investment in the Products. </span></p><p><span>Moreover, changes in the regulation of Crypto Assets, or certain Crypto Assets, including with respect to Underlyings or Underlying Components, may adversely impact the Issuer, the value of the Products, the value of any of the Underlyings or Underlying Components and the value of the Principal. As a result, Investors bear the risk of a loss of part or all of their investment. </span></p><p><strong><span>Tax Risk related to Crypto Assets</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The taxation of Crypto Assets and associated products can vary significantly by jurisdiction and are subject to significant revisions. These revisions, or the application of new tax schemes or taxation in additional jurisdictions, may adversely impact the Issuer’s performance. Furthermore, the status of Crypto Assets remains undefined and there is uncertainty as to whether the underlying Crypto Assets are a security, money, a commodity or property. Accordingly, the way in which Crypto Assets are taxed varies from country to country. Before making a decision to invest in Products, Investors should consult their local tax advisor on taxation. </span></p><p><span>The Issuer may become exposed to significant tax risk. Any major tax burden may hinder the Issuer’s ability to continue to operate as expected. </span></p><p><strong><span>Valuation of Crypto Assets</span></strong></p><p><span>The market value of Crypto Assets is not related to any specific company, government or asset. The valuation of these assets depends on future expectations for the value of the network, number of transactions and the overall usage of the asset. This means that a significant amount of the value in Crypto Assets is speculative and could lead to increased volatility. Investors could experience significant gains, losses and/or volatility depending on the valuation of Crypto Assets through the exposure to Underlyings or Underlying Components by the Products. </span></p><p><span>Valuation may also vary significantly by geography, as local exchanges are not necessarily compatible with all Crypto Assets and assets may be difficult to move in and out of any specific market. As a result, geographic arbitrage can have a considerable effect on valuation and, in turn, on the returns from Underlyings or Underlying Components and the Products. </span></p><p><span>Momentum pricing of Crypto Assets has previously resulted, and may continue to result, in speculation regarding future appreciation or depreciation in the value of such assets, further contributing to volatility and potentially inflating prices at any given time. As a result, pricing of Crypto Assets may change due to shifting Investor confidence in future outlook of the asset class. These dynamics may impact the value of an investment in Products. </span></p><p><strong><span>Potential for Market Abuse</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The markets of Underlyings and/or Underlying Components is growing rapidly. These markets are local, national and international and include a broadening range of products and participants. Significant trading may occur on systems and platforms with minimum predictability. Any sudden, rapid change in demand and supply of any Underlyings, especially those with a small market capitalization or small unit price, could cause significant price volatilities. In addition, most Crypto Assets are not backed by any central government, resulting in different regulatory standards across countries and regions. See </span><em><span>“Country-specific Regulatory Risk</span></em><span>”. While the Issuer only interacts with regulated or self-regulated exchanges with KYC/AML policies, there are a number of other Crypto Asset exchanges that have significantly fewer stringent checks. Furthermore, there can also be no assurance that the KYC/AML policies of the exchanges used by the Issuer will be sufficiently robust. The characteristic of the Underlyings and underlying infrastructure could be used by certain market participants to exploit arbitrage opportunities through schemes such as front-running, spoofing, pump-and-dump and fraud across different systems, platforms or geographic locations. As a result of reduced oversight, these schemes may be more prevalent in the Crypto Asset market than in the general market for financial products. </span></p><p><span>Any market abuse, and a loss of Investor confidence in the Underlyings and/or Underlying Components, may adversely impact an investment in the Products, the ability of the Issuer to operate and broad pricing trends in any individual Underlying or in Crypto Assets as a whole. </span></p><p><strong><span>Failure of Crypto Exchanges</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Disruptions at crypto exchanges and potential consequences of a crypto exchange’s failure could adversely affect the performance of the Underlying and the Products. Crypto exchanges operate websites on which users can trade Crypto Assets for fiat currencies, such as U.S. Dollars and Euros, or other digital assets. Trades on these exchanges can be unrelated to transfers of the Crypto Assets between users via the respective crypto network if the exchange co-mingles funds and does not offer a unique wallet address for each customer. For example, comingling refers to a lack of segregation of customer assets and is a common practice among many crypto exchanges. These exchanges might not provide a unique wallet for each user and as a result, might have one or more large Wallets composed of the assets of several users, comingled. This results in a centralization of a large amount of assets in a single location and could therefore increase the amount of damage or theft that can be done from a negative situation such as a hack. </span></p><p><span>As a result, sometimes Crypto Assets’ trades on Crypto Assets exchanges are recorded on the crypto exchange’s internal ledger only, and each internal ledger entry for a trade will correspond to an entry for an offsetting trade in government currency or other digital asset. To sell Crypto Assets on a crypto exchange, a user will transfer Crypto Assets (using the Crypto Assets network) from himself or herself to the crypto exchange. Conversely, to buy Crypto Assets on a crypto exchange, a user will transfer fiat currency or other digital assets to the crypto exchange. After completing the transfer of Crypto Assets or fiat currency, the user will execute its trade and receive either the Crypto Assets (using the Crypto Assets network) or the fiat currency back into its account. </span></p><p><strong><span>Technical Risks Related to Crypto Assets</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>There are a number of technical risks to which Investors in Crypto Assets are exposed including, but not limited to, flaws in the code, forks in the underlying protocols, Double Spend and 51% attacks, as further described below. </span></p><p><span>Bitcoin, Ether, and other Crypto Assets are often built on open-source code available to the general public. This makes the underlying source code of these Crypto Assets visible publicly to anyone, anywhere. While the top Crypto Assets sometimes have dedicated teams of contributors, it is often the case that they are unpaid and not full-time employees or contractors. For these reasons, it is possible that flaws or mistakes in the released and public source code could lead to catastrophic damage to the underlying technology, Crypto Assets and networks. It is possible that the volunteer or undedicated team members are unable to stop this damage before it spreads further. It is further possible that a dedicated team or a group of contributors or other technical group may attack the code, directly leading to catastrophic damage. In any of these situations, the value of Investors’ holdings can be severely and detrimentally affected. </span></p><p><span>Crypto Assets miners earn Crypto Assets by confirming transactions and reaching consensus. The results of this agreement are displayed on the public ledger known as the blockchain. If a single miner, or a group of miners acting in concert, control (even temporarily) a majority of the network mining power (known as hash power) of a particular blockchain network, they could use this control to undertake harmful acts. Such an attack is called a </span><strong><span>51% attack</span></strong><span>. For example, an individual or group controlling a majority of the Bitcoin network could prevent transactions from posting accurately, or at all, on the blockchain. Furthermore, they could allow for their coins to be spent on multiple occasions and would, in this scenario, have enough network control to confirm and post these transactions to the blockchain, in an attack referred to as </span><strong><span>Double Spending</span></strong><span>. In a Double Spending situation, the related record of the transaction, posted on the public ledger Blockchain, would become falsified. This could have a detrimental effect on both the sender and the receiver. There are several ways a nefarious cybercriminal could attempt a double-spend, including, but not limited to, sending two conflicting transactions to the network, and creating one transaction but sending the Crypto Assets before releasing that associated block to the blockchain, which would invalidate it. On an exchange with multiple currency trading pairs, it would be possible for a person or individual controlling the majority of a blockchain network to double-spend the coins they control and then subsequently trade them for other currency pairs and transfer them off the exchange to their own private wallet(s). This scenario is more likely to happen with smaller currencies (by measure of market capitalization) because of the reduced computing power threshold required to control a majority of the network, and has been documented happening multiple times, targeting currencies such as Bitcoin Gold and Verge. It is theoretically possible, even if it is sometimes computationally expensive, to mount a similar 51% or double spending attack on a large currency (by measure of market cap), including Ether and Bitcoin. The Underlyings and/or the Underlying Components may also be negatively affected by technical risks such as a 51% attack or Double Spend. </span></p><p><span>The infrastructure and ecosystem that power Crypto Assets such as Bitcoin and Ether are developed by different parties, including affiliated and non-affiliated engineers, engineers, developers, miners, platform developers, evangelists, marketers, exchange operators and other companies based around a service regarding the underlying Crypto Assets, each of whom may have different motivations, drivers, philosophies and incentives. There is, accordingly, a risk that these parties disagree on the future direction of these technologies, which may impede or otherwise negatively affect the development of the technology and, in turn, lead to losses with respect to an Investor’s investment. </span></p><p><span>In cases of particularly strong disagreements, a developer or group of developers can split the code base into two or more branches of variations of development, in what is called a fork.  One of the most prominent examples to date was a fork of Bitcoin that occurred in 2017, taking effect on 1 August 2017, which created the cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash. Although Bitcoin Cash is the largest Bitcoin fork (as measured by market capitalization), Bitcoin has had at least three other major forks of the network (Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited), as well as three major forks of the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG) and Bitcoin Private (BTCP)). It is possible that Bitcoin’s network and/or cryptocurrency will be forked more times in the future. The same has occurred with the second largest cryptocurrency (as measured by market cap), Ether. After a nefarious attack on a venture capital project built on Ethereum called The DAO, the newly-forked cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) was created, which took away the effects of the hack. The sub-group in the community that refused the hard fork continued to use the original Ethereum blockchain, citing immutability concerns (being against any change in the blockchain on principle), which today is called Ether Classic (ETC). Forks occur throughout the range of Crypto Assets and are not limited to just the largest or most popular products. </span></p><p><span>Forks may have a detrimental effect on the value of the Crypto Assets, including by negatively affecting cryptocurrency allocations or by failing to capture of the full value of the newly-forked Crypto Asset if it is removed from the main Index or another applicable Index that serves as an Underlying of any Product for one or more months. </span></p><p><strong><span>Usage and Network Participation</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Today, there is limited use of Crypto Assets in the retail, commercial, or payments spaces. On a relative basis, speculators make up a significant portion of users. This pattern may contribute to outsized price volatility. </span></p><p><span>Furthermore, for mined Crypto Assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, the incentives for miners to contribute processing power to the respective networks are set to decrease over time. See “—</span><em><span>Cease in Expansion of Processing Power</span></em><span>”. The implementation of fees for transactions may result in decreased usage and limit expansion of these or other protocols in the retail, commercial and payments space, adversely impacting investment in the Products. See “</span><em><span>— Potential of Collusion to Raise Transaction Fees”</span></em><span>. Conversely, if the reward for miners or the value of the transaction fees is insufficient to motivate miners, they may cease expending processing power for any blockchain to solve blocks and confirm transactions. </span></p><p><strong><span>Cease in Expansion of Processing Power</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Miners generate revenue from both newly created Crypto Assets (known as the “block reward”) and from fees taken upon verification of transactions. If the aggregate revenue from transaction fees and the block reward is below a miner’s cost, the miner may cease operations. Additionally, in the event of a fork of the relevant Crypto Asset network, some miners may choose to mine the alternative new Crypto Asset  resulting from the fork, thus reducing processing power on the original blockchain. An acute cessation of mining operations would reduce the collective processing power on the blockchain, which would adversely affect the transaction verification process by temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to the blockchain and make the blockchain more vulnerable to a malicious actor obtaining control in excess of 50% of the processing power on the blockchain. Reductions in processing power could result in material, though temporary, delays in transaction confirmation time. Any reduction in confidence in the transaction verification process or mining processing power may adversely impact the value of an investment in the Products or the ability of the Issuer to operate. </span></p><p><strong><span>Potential of Collusion to Raise Transaction Fees</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Crypto Asset miners, functioning in their transaction confirmation capacity, collect fees for each transaction they confirm. Miners validate unconfirmed transactions by adding the previously unconfirmed transactions to new blocks in the blockchain. Miners are not forced to confirm any specific transaction, but they are economically incentivized to confirm valid transactions as a means of collecting fees. Miners have historically accepted relatively low transaction confirmation fees, because miners have a very low marginal cost of validating unconfirmed transactions. If miners collude in an anticompetitive manner to reject low transaction fees, then Crypto Asset users could be forced to pay higher fees, thus reducing the attractiveness of the relevant Crypto Asset network. Crypto Assets mining occurs globally, and it may be difficult for authorities to apply antitrust regulations across multiple jurisdictions. Any collusion among miners may adversely impact the attractiveness of Crypto Asset networks and may adversely impact the value of an investment in the Products or the ability of the Issuer to operate. </span></p><p><strong><span>Market Moving Events</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>The price of underlying assets may be affected by other vehicles investing in or otherwise tracking the crypto market. These include, but are not limited to, future contracts, funds and exchange traded products. If any of these instruments investing in the asset class come to represent a significant portion of demand or supply, large issuances or redemptions could impact the global price of the asset and value of the Products. </span></p><p><strong><span>Innovation</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>It is currently unclear which Crypto Assets will become dominant, as the sector continues to innovate and evolve. Changes in the viability of any crypto ecosystem may adversely impact pricing and liquidity of the Crypto Assets and, therefore, of the Products. </span></p><p><strong><span>Competition</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Crypto Assets face significant competition amongst each other, as well as from other technologies or payment forms, such as Swift, ACH, remittance networks, credit cards and cash. Crypto Assets make up a very small percentage of global payments. There is no guarantee that Crypto Assets will become a dominant form of payments, store of value or method of exchange. </span></p><p><strong><span>Limited Liquidity and Trading Volume</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Liquidity in Crypto Assets is significantly lower than other major currencies, such as U.S. Dollars, Euros or Japanese Yen, as well as certain stocks, bonds and structured products. As such, there is a greater possibility of market moving events such as a single large sale effecting the global market. Furthermore, liquidity crunches may also occur as a result of lower overall liquidity. In this case, it may be difficult or impossible to buy or sell underlying Crypto Assets, resulting in a significant loss of value. This risk increases significantly as the market capitalization and liquidity of a Crypto Asset declines and, accordingly, may be a more important risk for assets with lower market capitalization, such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. </span></p><p><strong><span>Large-Scale Sales of Crypto Assets</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Political or economic events, either domestically or in foreign jurisdictions, may motivate large-scale buys or sales of Crypto Assets. Large-scale sales of Crypto Assets may result in a decline in the price of Crypto Assets, which may adversely affect an investment in the Products. </span></p><p><strong><span>Actions of Early Crypto Asset Adopters</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>There is no registry showing which individuals or entities own Crypto Assets or the quantity of Crypto Assets owned by any particular person or entity. It is possibly, and in fact, reasonably likely, that a small group of early Crypto Assets adopters hold a significant proportion of the Crypto Assets that has thus far been created. There are no regulations in place that would prevent a large holder of Crypto Assets from selling their Crypto Assets. Such Crypto Assets sales may adversely affect the price of Crypto Assets and an investment in the Products. </span></p><p><strong><span>RISK FACTORS RELATING TO SPECIFIC UNDERLYINGS OR UNDERLYING COMPONENTS</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>Risks Specific to Bitcoin (BTC)</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><em><span>Production Risk</span></em><span>: Bitcoin is a mined currency, which requires significant use of energy, space and computing power. Should the incentives for miners of the Crypto Asset be insufficient or the costs of validating transactions grow disproportionately, miners could transition to other networks, which could, in turn, slow transaction validation and usage. Any disruption to the production of Bitcoin or the validation of Bitcoin transactions could adversely impact the price of the asset. </span></p><p><em><span>Limited Use Cases</span></em><span>: Bitcoin can sometimes be unsuited for real time payments, as transactions can take considerable time to clear. As such, it is unsuited for a number of commercial uses. This could result in decreasing usage of the network if Bitcoin does not become a store of value asset or meet the needs of another commercial use. </span></p><p><strong><span>Risks Specific to Ether (ETH)</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><em><span>Production Risk</span></em><span>: Ether is a mined currency, which requires significant use of energy, space, and computing power. Should the incentives for miners of the Crypto Asset be insufficient or the costs of validating transactions grow disproportionately, miners could transition to other networks, which could, in turn, slow transaction validation and usage. Any disruption to the production of Ether or the validation of Ethereum transactions could adversely impact the price of the asset. </span></p><p><em><span>Usage</span></em><span>: While Ether is expected to have a wide range of uses outside of payment, these use cases are still limited in scale. It is unclear how usage of Ether will continue to evolve. Should these additional use cases fail to materialize, it may cause a significant loss of value to the Ethereum network. </span></p><p><em><span>Change of the Consensus Mechanism</span></em><span>: The Ethereum network is moving to &quot;proof-of-stake&quot; which entails certain unique risks, such as malicious unilateral actions by actors who have a significant share of the total available Ether in the Ethereum network. In this scenario, the malicious unilateral actions that may be possible include doublespending, forking, stopping &amp; rejecting transactions and preventing new transactions from being confirmed on the Ethereum network. This could adversely impact an investment in the Products.</span></p></div></div>
